# Response diversity survey analysis
This repository contains the scripts and visual outputs of the Response Diversity Network Survey.

To preserve respondent anonymity, the shared data has been shuffled (within each column) and free-text responses lightly revised to remove any content that would link responses to particular individual or research group. Therefore, re-running the analyses will not yield identical results to those published in the corresponding manuscript (Ross et al. 2025). We appreciate your understanding in prioritising anonymity over reproducibility.
