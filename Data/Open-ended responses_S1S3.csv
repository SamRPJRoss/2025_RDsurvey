Briefly consider an ecological community composed of a number of plant species, each of which has a slightly different preferred environmental condition. Under natural conditions, the environment (temperature, nutrient availability, weather etc.) changes on predictable cycles such as the diurnal and annual seasonal cycles, and less predictably through stochastic environmental changes to environmental conditions (e.g. an a-typically prolonged drought) and via longer-term climate change. Researchers and ecosystem managers may be interested in ensuring the continued functioning of this community and its contributions to people.
