Q9_1,"Briefly consider an ecological community composed of a number of plant species, each of which has a slightly different preferred environmental condition. Under natural conditions, the environment (temperature, nutrient availability, weather etc.) changes on predictable cycles such as the diurnal and annual seasonal cycles, and less predictably through stochastic environmental changes to environmental conditions (e.g. an a-typically prolonged drought) and via longer-term climate change. Researchers and ecosystem managers may be interested in ensuring the continued functioning of this community and its contributions to people.  In this regard they may measure, monitor, or manage for the persistence of the community through time (do populations of species persist without going locally extinct?) as well as the stability (low variability) of the total community biomass or species composition through time.

Considering the above example, at what temporal scale might you consider response diversity to be the most relevant to measure, monitor, or manage for persistence or stability in this way?

Sliding scale from 1-100, roughly:
1-20 = Very fine scales (e.g. minutes, hours)
21-40 = e.g. Daily-seasonal
41-60 = e.g. between yrs (1-2 years)
